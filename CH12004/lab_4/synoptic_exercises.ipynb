    "**1.** There are several infinite series that converge to something proportional to $\\pi$. For example, the Basel series is defined as an infinite sum of reciprocal square numbers:\n",

    "a) Write a function to approximate $\\pi$ by evaluating the Basel series up to a given term $n$. Test your function for $n = 1000$.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Another infinite series that converges to something proportional to $\\pi$ is the Leibniz formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$1 - \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{1}{9} - \\cdots = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^{n}}{2n + 1} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}.$$\n",
