    "Let's unpack this code. The output matches our previous attempt to calculate the squared temperatures, so clearly this approach is ultimately doing the same thing: calculating $T^{2}$ for each temperature in our `list` of `temperatures`. This is an example of a **loop**, or more specifically a `for` **loop**. As the name suggests, a `for` loop allows us to **loop** over every **element** of a list and to do something `for` each one. The general syntax reads something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for item in iterable:\n",
    "    do_something_with_each_item\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "An **iterable** is simply any object that can be **iterated** i.e. it contains a sequence of items that can be accessed one after another. In our example, the `temperatures` list is our **iterable**: it is a sequence of numbers that can be iterated through in a logical order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, so the first line in our loop example is: `for T in temperatures`. As we just discussed, `temperatures` is our **iterable**, so the latter part of this line (`in temperatures`) reads as \"We are going to loop through each element of the `temperatures` list\". The former part of the line (`for T`) tells us that at each iteration of the loop, we will **assign** the next item in `temperatures` to the variable `T`.\n",
    "\n",
    "After ending the first line with a colon `:`, the second line is **indented** beneath. This **indentation** is usually achieved with either **four spaces** (just pressing the spacebar four times) or a single **tab** character (just pressing the **tab** key once). The second line describes **what we would like to do** with each element of our iterable. In our example, each element is a temperature from the `temperatures` list, which is assigned to the variable `T` at each iteration of the loop. We would like to calculate the **squared** temperature, so we print `T ** 2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to summarise, at the first iteration of our loop, `T` is assigned to the first element of `temperatures`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "T = temperatures[0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the second line runs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(T ** 2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we reach the second iteration of the loop, so `T` is assigned to the **next** element of `temperatures`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "T = temperatures[1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And so on and so forth. The variable assignements as written above are **implicit** in the general syntax of a `for` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run more code **after** the loop has been completed, we remove the **indent**:"
