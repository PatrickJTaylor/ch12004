    "**1.** The distance between two points $i$ and $j$ in two-dimensional space can be calculated with the following equation:\n",

    "$$d(i, j) = \\sqrt{(x_{i} - x_{j})^{2} + (y_{i} - y_{j})^{2}},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x_{i}$ is the $x$-coordinate of point $i$, $x_{j}$ is the $x$-coordinate of point $j$ etc.\n",

    "a) Write a function to calculate the distance between two points, where each point is a `list` of $x$, $y$ and $z$ coordinates:\n",

    "b) The atoms in a molecule of BF$_{3}$ are located at the following coordinates:\n",

    "This is a **nested list** (a list of lists), where each **sublist** contains the coordinates associated with one atom.\n",

    "Using [loops](../lab_3/loops.ipynb), calculate and `print` the distances between **all pairs of atoms** in BF$_{3}$. Use the function you wrote in a) to calculate each distance.\n",

    "You will need a **nested loop** to generate all possible pairs of atoms.\n",
    "```\n",

    "a) Write a function that uses a loop to calculate the [factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) of a **positive** non-zero number $n$:\n",
