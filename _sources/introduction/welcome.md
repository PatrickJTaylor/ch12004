# Welcome

Welcome to the Python component of **CH12004: Skills for chemists**! This "book" is designed to introduce you to programming with Python, or more generally, to using programming as a tool for data analysis.

```{tip} A word of advice for those of you who are new to programming: **computers are stupid**. Learning to program can be thought of as learning to think like a machine: systematically, logically and (at least as it may seem to us insufferable know-it-alls) **stupidly**.
```
